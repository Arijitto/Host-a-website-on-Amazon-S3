# Host-a-website-on-Amazon-S3
Amazon S3 enables static website hosting for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. The process involves creating an S3 bucket, enabling static website hosting, uploading files, setting public permissions, and optionally using Route 53 for a custom domain. CloudFront can be added for HTTPS and performance optimization.
